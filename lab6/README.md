1. Useful
   In terms of how useful the weather app is, I think that it is useful if the user wants to access the current weather and the weather in the next few weeks. The weather app provides many statistics on the weather such as wind, pressure, sunrise and sunset, preciptation, feels like temp, visibility etc. All the information one would need on the weather in their current location would be found here. If the user wanted to use this website for other locations, they would not be able to do so in this app as it only shows the weather in your current location
2. Usable
   I think that the app is very easy to use as everything is located in a logical manner and there are no complex elements or features in the app that would make it hard to use. Users just have to scroll down and view all the stats that they need on the weather. One small hiccup that the users might run into is having to pull the weather from the API every time because of the changes that were implemented in lab 3.
3. Findable
   All the information on the page is easily accessed as it is a single webpage. However, when the user goes to the base of my github repository from the FDQN, it leads them to a folder and file directory that is defaulted becuase there is no webpage. The user will have to guess which lab is what, which contributes to sub par findability.
4. Credible
   There are many ways that this site is not credible, from the abstract link, which may make the website feel gimmicky, or how there is no citing of the APIs on the web page to show that the information coming from a credible source. However, some ways that the site does seem credible is the good layout of the elements and if the user does decide to use this website over time, they will realize the accuracy of the weather data.
5. Accessible
   As of now, the images do not have alt tags on them, and there are no other accessible features that are available. This weather app website is not accessible. However, there are no elements that lead to epillepsy
6. Desirable
   All though the weather app does seem desirable without context, where it does a good job displaying the weather in an easy to read format, there is no motivation for the customer to use this weather app over other weather apps that contain more data in more areas. In addition, this weather app is not supported on mobile devices, which is where most people check their weather, not their computers. Without this weather app in people's lives, there is little to no effect on them as there are many other services that outperform this weather app.
7. Valuable
   Similar to desirable, however, there are other weather apps on the web designed for computers that provide better details and animations, such as preciptation maps and more specfic weather information. In addition, other weather apps provide news information along with weather information.
