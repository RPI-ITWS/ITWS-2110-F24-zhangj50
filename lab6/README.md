1. Useful
   In terms of how useful the weather app is, I think that it is useful if the user wants to access the current weather and the weather in the next few weeks. The weather app provides many statistics on the weather such as wind, pressure, sunrise and sunset, preciptation, feels like temp, visibility etc. All the information one would need on the weather in their current location would be found here. If the user wanted to use this website for other locations, they would not be able to do so in this app as it only shows the weather in your current location
2. Usable
   I think that the app is very easy to use as everything is located in a logical manner and there are no complex elements or features in the app that would make it hard to use. Users just have to scroll down and view all the stats that they need on the weather. One small hiccup that the users might run into is having to pull the weather from the API every time because of the changes that were implemented in lab 3.
3. Findable
   All the information on the page is easily accessed as it is a single webpage. However, when the user goes to the base of my github repository from the FDQN, it leads them to a folder and file directory that is defaulted becuase there is no webpage. The user will have to guess which lab is what, which contributes to sub par findability.
4. Credible
   There are many ways that this site is not credible, from the abstract link, which may make the website feel gimmicky, or how there is no citing of the APIs on the web page to show that the information coming from a credible source. However, some ways that the site does seem credible is the good layout of the elements and if the user does decide to use this website over time, they will realize the accuracy of the weather data.
5. Accessible
   As of now, not all images have alt tags on them, and there are no other accessible features that are available. This weather app website is not accessible. However, there are no elements that lead to epilepsy such as flashing elements.
6. Desirable
   All though the weather app does seem desirable without context, where it does a good job displaying the weather in an easy to read format, there is no motivation for the customer to use this weather app over other weather apps that contain more data in more areas. In addition, this weather app is not supported on mobile devices, which is where most people check their weather, not their computers. Without this weather app in people's lives, there is little to no effect on them as there are many other services that outperform this weather app.
7. Valuable
   Similar to desirable, however, there are other weather apps on the web designed for computers that provide better details and animations, such as preciptation maps and more specfic weather information. In addition, other weather apps provide news information along with weather information.

   Changes I made:

   1. For accessibility, I added alt tags to all the images

   2. Doherty threshold: I added a loading icon that loads even though the content may be already loaded. According to the laws of UX, this is supposed to "perceive value and instill a sense of trust". This law relates closest to credibility, as the loading icon shows that the website is taking the time to provide accurate information.

   3. Chunking: The weather app is currently chunked well to seperate different sections and information. For example, the forecast gets it's own background and box, and all the wind items are all grouped together because they are all related, also seperated by a box. All the different weather information is seperated into different boxes in the bottom so that the user can focus on them one at a time. This law relates to usability, as chunking related items together helps with processing information with ease, which makes the weather app more usable

   4. Selective Attention: To make my website's element's more findable, I used the law of selective attention. Previously, the buttons were placed on the top of the screen, which often is ignored because it is placed in an ad like location. To make these buttons more noticed, I put them in the div where all the other elements are. This law relates to the findable lens.

   5. Findability: In order to find the labs from the root directory, I added an index.html in the root so that the user is able to go to what lab or app that they wanted to see. It's very simple with links to each lab directory.
